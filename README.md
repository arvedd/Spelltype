# SpellType

**SpellType** is a typing-based dungeon crawler game where you play as a young mage learning the Ancient Language.
To cast spells, you must type them correctly, as if reciting mantras from an ancient spellbook.

Explore dungeons, recover lost pages of the Spellbook of Origin, and face powerful enemies—including the ultimate test against your own mentor.
